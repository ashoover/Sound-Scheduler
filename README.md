# Sound-Scheduler
A quick python script to schedule sounds on time intervals

Does not save state so if you close the program, it removes all the sound play tasks.

.exe is located in the "dist" folder.  Just place the "sound_player.exe" and the "app.ico" somewhere on your PC and run it.

.exe was compiled with "PyInstaller"
